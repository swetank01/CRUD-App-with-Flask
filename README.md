# CRUD with flask - author-manager
 
we’ll be creating a RESTful Flask application from scratch. Here we’ll maintain a database of Author objects alongside the books they have written. This application will have a user authentication mechanism to only allow logged-in users to execute certain functions. We’ll now create the following API endpoints for our REST applications:

1. GET /authors: This gets list of authors alongside their books.
2. GET /authors/<id>: This gets author with the specified ID alongside their books.
3. POST /authors: This creates a new Author object.
4. PUT /authors/<id>: This will edit author object with the given ID.
5. DELETE /authors/<id>: This will delete the author with the given ID.
6. GET /books: This will return all the books.
7. GET /books/<id>: This gets the book with the specified ID.
8. POST /books: This creates a new book object.
9. PUT / books/<id>: This will edit book object with the given ID.
10. DELETE /book/<id>: This will delete the book with the given ID.
